Port of the [texture](https://github.com/rmed/texture) Python library for Rust.

**Probably very unstable, bear with me**.

## Features

- Scenario based architecture
- Global game state
- Some utilities
- Main game loop (including command input)

That's it. This is only a (pretty simple) tool, and you are the artist. Want
your game to calculate x digits of *pi*? Well, go for it!
